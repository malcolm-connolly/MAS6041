Some of the steps in this process were computationally intensive.
In order to work more efficiently I saved larger objects for later use as RData files.

The largest of these objects is the lookup table X.
Unfortunately X is too large to upload to the GitHub repo.
X is generated in file Ch3_seven_items.R
I have also zipped the RData file as an option.
